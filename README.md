** Training of Model (Resnet50):
1. (in a seprate terminal)
1. ```ipython3 Resnet50_train.ipynb ``` 

** Running of API-service (Resnet50):
1. (in a seprate terminal)
1. Install FastAPI Library:
  ``` pip3 install fastapi
      pip3 install python-multipart
  ```
1. Run the API Car model classification server: ``` fastapi dev  APIserver.py  ```
1. Test:
  ```
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/" -F "file=@./cars_test/cars_test/00386.jpg"
  ```

** Testing with Swagger.API
1. Go to URL: https://editor.swagger.io/
1. Import the API definition file from ```swagger.yaml```
1. Import image files for testing
